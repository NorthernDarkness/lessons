There is a class that has a Map<Integer, Integer> filed filled by some data. The task is to write a method in this class
 that has an integer argument and checks whether this map has a value by this key.
  If it does - return the value from the map, if not - add the new entry into the map with this key and value = key+1 and return the value.

You have a template:

class Lambda{
    public static void main (String[] args) {
    .....
	}

    public static double calculate(int x, int y, .....){
       	return ....;
    }
}

Update  calculate() method signature and add its body to make a single method calculator. It has to be able to:

    add;
    multiply;
    divide;
    subtract;
    to calculate the square root;
    to raise to a power;
    raise to a power the sum of arguments divided by the first argument + 117;
    and any other operations you can made up.

    invoke all actions in the main method to make sure they work.
